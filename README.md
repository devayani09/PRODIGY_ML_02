Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering
This project uses the Mall_Customers.csv dataset to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters using the K-means algorithm, helping businesses tailor marketing strategies effectively. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature scaling, and determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method. The quality of clusters is evaluated using the Silhouette Score, with further exploration of alternative clustering techniques like GMM and DBSCAN. Visualizations such as scatter plots and t-SNE are provided for cluster analysis.
